## My plan
1) Put in the basic HTML with an image, facts about me, and a button.
2) Add id's to the button and to a field below the button where the results print, these are so I can read a button click and print the result of my quiz so the user can see. ACP
3) Time to write tests. I want a test for true and false(user inputs of yes or no). My function will be called isYes.
4) Once tests are working I'll create a utils.js file to export my function from to all files that need it. I'll use toLowerCase so that any input('yes' or 'Yes' or 'YES') all read the same to the function. Then I'll use an if else with a variable word to see if the user input === 'yes' or 'y'. ACP
5) Once the function is working i'll replace the results.textContent with the users name and score on the test so the state is updated. ACP
6) Once the quiz works and after commiting i'll work on the HTML and CSS to make my app more unique and me. ACP
7) Then I'll just read through and see if anything can be simplified. ACP
8) Submit the assignment!
